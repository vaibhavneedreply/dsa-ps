The two-pointer technique is a useful strategy for solving various types of problems efficiently, especially those involving searching, sorting, and processing sequences (like arrays or strings). To decide if you can use the two-pointer approach to solve a problem, consider the following guidelines:

- Dealing with Sorted Arrays:
- When you need to find a specific part of an array or string that meets a condition (like having a certain sum or containing unique characters), two pointers can help.
- If you need to compare elements from different parts of a list, like checking if a string reads the same forward and backward (a palindrome), you can use two pointers. 
- When you need to maintain a range of elements that meet certain criteria, like the longest substring without repeating characters, two pointers can create and adjust this range efficiently.
- Use two pointers when you need to efficiently search, compare, or maintain a range in arrays or strings.
- One pointer can start at the beginning and the other at the end, or both can start from the same point and move together.


1. Running from both ends of an array (The first type of problems are, having two pointers at left and right end of array, then moving them to the center while processing something with them.)
